# G2 verified GitHub-to-VPS release delivery

This runbook bootstraps and operates the Phase G2 PAPER deployment path. GitHub is the release and deployment control plane; the dedicated Linux VPS remains the runtime. The deployment path never creates, copies, reads, edits, or deletes `/etc/shreks/shreks.env`, `/etc/shreks/paper-campaign.json`, or `/var/lib/shreks`.

**LIVE TRADING: DISABLED.**

## Trust and authority boundary

A Shreks release is identified by one exact sealed source SHA and immutable GitHub Release tag `shreks-<40-character-sha>`. The deploy workflow accepts only an existing GitHub Release, downloads its tarball, checksum, and manifest, verifies them locally with `release_bundle.py`, then transfers only those three files to the VPS.

The deploy SSH key is a deployment transport credential only. It is separate from any future trading key and must never be reused as a trading key, signing key, provider credential, or runtime secret. Trading credentials remain host-only. GitHub Environment secret population is account configuration, not repository content.

## One-time VPS bootstrap

Run these steps from a trusted administrator session on the VPS after the G1C host layout exists.

Create a dedicated unprivileged deploy account:

```sh
sudo useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash shreks-deploy
sudo install -d -o shreks-deploy -g shreks-deploy -m 0700 /home/shreks-deploy/.ssh
```

Install the G2 verifier and manager from the exact sealed G2 source checkout. Both files are root-owned and are not writable by the deploy account:

```sh
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 deploy/release/release_bundle.py /usr/local/sbin/release_bundle.py
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 deploy/release/release_manager.py /usr/local/sbin/shreks-release-manager
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/sbin/release_bundle.py /usr/local/sbin/shreks-release-manager
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/sbin/release_bundle.py /usr/local/sbin/shreks-release-manager
```

Install the deployment public key into `/home/shreks-deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys`, owned by `shreks-deploy:shreks-deploy` with mode `0600`. The corresponding private deploy SSH key is stored only in the GitHub `production-paper` environment as `SHREKS_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`.

Create `/etc/sudoers.d/shreks-release-manager` as root with this single deployment command shape:

```text
shreks-deploy ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/shreks-release-manager install /var/tmp/shreks-release-*.tar.gz /var/tmp/shreks-release-*.tar.gz.sha256 /var/tmp/shreks-release-*.RELEASE_MANIFEST.json
```

Then validate and lock the file:

```sh
sudo chown root:root /etc/sudoers.d/shreks-release-manager
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/shreks-release-manager
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/shreks-release-manager
```

Do not grant the deploy account general passwordless sudo, an interactive root shell, direct write access to `/opt/shreks`, or access to protected runtime configuration/state.

## GitHub `production-paper` environment

Configure exactly these deployment transport secrets in the GitHub `production-paper` environment:

- `SHREKS_DEPLOY_HOST` — pinned VPS hostname.
- `SHREKS_DEPLOY_PORT` — SSH port.
- `SHREKS_DEPLOY_USER` — `shreks-deploy`.
- `SHREKS_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` — private key matching the deploy account public key.
- `SHREKS_DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS` — trusted pinned host-key line obtained out-of-band from the VPS provider or trusted administrator channel.

Do not populate runtime provider credentials, strategy/risk overrides, campaign configuration, or future trading key material in this environment. The deploy SSH key and any trading key are different credentials and must never be copied into each other's storage boundary.

## Create a release

Use the manual `Build sealed Shreks release` workflow with the exact 40-character SHA of a sealed commit. The workflow checks out that exact SHA, confirms the commit subject contains `seal`, reruns repository safety plus Rust and Python tests, builds the allowlisted bundle, verifies it, rejects a duplicate tag, and creates `shreks-<sha>`.

Release assets are exactly:

```text
shreks-release-<sha>.tar.gz
shreks-release-<sha>.tar.gz.sha256
RELEASE_MANIFEST.json
```

## Deploy a release

Run the manual `Deploy verified Shreks release` workflow with the existing release tag. The workflow validates the tag, checks out the verifier at that release, downloads the three assets, verifies them before host contact, uses strict pinned host-key checking, copies the assets to `/var/tmp`, and invokes only:

```text
sudo /usr/local/sbin/shreks-release-manager install <archive> <checksum> <manifest>
```

The release manager re-verifies the bundle, stages `/opt/shreks/releases/<sha>`, constructs the release-local Python environment at its final SHA path, re-verifies stored payloads, installs systemd unit files, atomically switches `/opt/shreks/current`, starts `shreks.target`, and checks health. If activation fails after a prior release was active, the manager restores the previous verified release and its previous unit files.

## Provenance and health checks

After deployment, verify the active immutable release identity and manifest on the VPS:

```sh
readlink -f /opt/shreks/current
cat /opt/shreks/current/RELEASE_MANIFEST.json
sudo systemctl is-active shreks.target
sudo systemctl status shreks-observe.service --no-pager
sudo systemctl status shreks-paper-evidence.service --no-pager
sudo systemctl status shreks-paper-campaign.service --no-pager
```

The resolved `current` path must end in the same 40-character SHA recorded in `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json`. The protected paths `/etc/shreks/shreks.env`, `/etc/shreks/paper-campaign.json`, and `/var/lib/shreks` remain outside release activation and rollback.

## Rollback

For rollback, select an earlier GitHub Release tag that was previously sealed and verified, then dispatch `Deploy verified Shreks release` with that earlier tag. The same local verification, strict transport, host verification, staging, and health gates apply to rollback; there is no separate bypass path.

If the earlier release is already present under `/opt/shreks/releases/<sha>`, the manager re-verifies its stored manifest and payload before activation. Never replace `/opt/shreks/current` manually and never edit a stored release in place.

## Operational notes

Release delivery proves provenance and rollback mechanics; it does not prove profitability, strategy quality, live readiness, or wallet safety for live capital. G2 remains a PAPER production-operations prerequisite. Any later live-capital phase must separately prove its own credential, risk, recovery, monitoring, emergency-control, and promotion gates before live enablement.
